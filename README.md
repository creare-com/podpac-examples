# PODPAC Examples

Repository that contains files and example Jupyter notebook demonstrating [PODPAC](https://github.com/creare-com/podpac) usage. To get started, make sure you have a [working version of PODPAC installed](https://podpac.org/install.html).

## Starting JupyterLab

1. Browse to the location of the `podpac-examples` repository
2. Launch a JupyterLab session

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```

## Viewing Markdown in JupterLab

To make a Markdown (.md) file more readable in JupyterLab (.e.g this README.md file):
* Right-click the text editor
* Select 'Show Markdown Preview'

A new window will open and show a nicely rendered version of the file.


## Using JupyterLab

The official documentation can be [found here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html), or from the help menu at the top of the JupyterLab browser window.

To launch an example:
* Browse to an example using the file-browser on the left panel
* Double-click the file 
* From the top menu, select `Run --> Run All`

There are multiple useful keyboard shortcuts, as shown below. For example, for evaluating cells in the notebook:
* `Ctrl-Enter`: Evaluate current cell
* `Shift-Enter`: Evaluate current cell and select the next cell
* `Alt-Enter`: Evaluate current cell and create a new cell after it
